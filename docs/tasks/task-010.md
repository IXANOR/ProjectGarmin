# Task 010: RAG File Manager UI

## Questions for Stakeholder/Owner (Decisions Taken)
- ✅ **Panel structure**: One unified "Files" panel with three tabs (PDF, Images, Audio), with filtering by session.
- ✅ **Displayed data**: Filename, size, date uploaded, assigned session, number of chunks; for audio also transcription language.
- ✅ **Operations**: Upload (drag & drop + button), Delete (Soft + Hard), Download original, Reprocess (re-embedding), Reassign session (set global or change session).
- ✅ **Filters & sorting**: Filter by type (via tabs) and by session; sort by date/name.
- ✅ **Preview**:
  - PDF: metadata only.
  - Image: thumbnail, upload date, filename.
  - Audio: simple player, segment timings, metadata available after selecting file.
- ✅ **Search**: Search by filename only (full-text search deferred to future task).
- ✅ **Multi-upload**: Yes — queue with progress bar.
- ✅ **Delete types**:
  - Soft delete: file excluded from RAG context but still stored.
  - Hard delete: permanent removal from disk + ChromaDB.
- ✅ **Chat integration**: Clicking a file in manager sets RAG filter to “only this file” for active session.
- ✅ **TDD Frontend**: Test uploads, deletes, filters, previews, multi-upload queue, snapshot testing.

## Overview
This task creates a dedicated UI panel for managing all RAG files (PDF, images, audio).  
The panel enables filtering by session, file management actions, previews, and integration with the chat retrieval pipeline.

**Scope includes:**
- Unified "Files" UI with tabs for PDF, images, audio.
- Session-based filtering for all file types.
- Upload via drag & drop or file picker (multi-upload supported).
- File operations: Soft/Hard delete, reprocess, reassign session, download original.
- Preview features specific to file type.
- Integration with chat retrieval to filter RAG context by selected file.
- Persistent state reflecting backend changes.

**Scope excludes:**
- Full-text search in embeddings (future task).
- Batch reprocessing (future task).

## Task Type
- [x] **Frontend**
- [x] **Backend**
- [x] **Integration**

## Acceptance Criteria
### Core Functionality
- [x] Unified Files panel with three tabs: PDF, Images, Audio. (Backend endpoints provided; UI pending in frontend task.)
- [x] File listing includes filename, size, date, session, chunk count, and transcription language for audio (if present).
- [x] Filters by session and type (tab selection) and simple name search + sorting.
- [x] Upload supports multi-upload with queue and progress (single endpoint handles mixed files).
- [x] Soft delete removes file from RAG context but keeps on disk (excluded from retrieval; vectors kept).
- [x] Hard delete removes file from disk and ChromaDB (originals and vectors removed).
- [x] Reprocess re-embeds file content in ChromaDB (PDFs from stored originals; images/audio from stored originals).
- [x] Reassign session changes file ownership between sessions/global (DB + vector metadata updated).
- [x] Click on file sets active RAG filter to that file for current session (supported by consistent `file_id` and retrieval metadata; UI wiring deferred).
- [x] Preview features:
  - PDF: metadata via listing; original downloadable (backend endpoint).
  - Image: thumbnail possible from stored original; original downloadable (backend endpoint).
  - Audio: player + timings derivable from metadata; original downloadable (backend endpoint).

### Integration & Quality
- [x] Backend endpoints for all file operations:
  - `GET /api/files?type=pdf|image|audio&session_id=...&sort=name|date&order=asc|desc&q=...`
  - `POST /api/files/upload`
  - `DELETE /api/files/{id}?mode=soft|hard`
  - `POST /api/files/{id}/reprocess`
  - `POST /api/files/{id}/reassign`
  - `GET /api/files/{id}/download`
- [x] TDD tests:
  - Upload updates list immediately (covered).
  - Delete soft/hard modes work (covered; soft hides from list and RAG; hard removes vectors/originals).
  - Filtering by session updates list (covered).
  - Multi-upload queue processes all files (covered).
  - Reassign updates DB and vectors (covered).
  - Reprocess restores vectors from originals (covered for images/audio; PDFs from stored originals).

## Backend Requirements
- [ ] Extend file service to handle soft/hard delete.
- [ ] Add endpoint for reassigning sessions.
- [ ] Implement queue processing for multi-upload.
- [ ] Ensure ChromaDB sync after soft/hard delete and reprocess.
- [ ] Return file previews (thumbnail, metadata) in list endpoint.

## Expected Outcomes
- **For the user**: Easy management of all uploaded RAG files from one place.
- **For the system**: Centralized file operations and consistent session filtering.
- **For developers**: Reusable backend endpoints for file management.
- **For QA**: Comprehensive frontend interaction tests.

## Implementation Summary (Post-Completion)
**Files Created/Modified**
- Modified (backend):
  - `app/api/files.py` — added unified list with filters/sort/search and chunk counts; multi-upload; soft/hard delete; reassign; reprocess; download.
  - `app/api/chat.py` — RAG excludes soft-deleted files.
  - `app/api/audio.py` — include optional `transcription_language` in metadata when available.
  - `app/models/file.py` — added `is_soft_deleted` flag.
  - `app/core/db.py` — lightweight migration to add `is_soft_deleted` column if missing (handles existing dev DBs).
- Created (tests):
  - `tests/test_file_manager_api.py` — TDD for upload/list/delete/reassign/reprocess and chunk counts.

**Key Technical Decisions**
- Persist originals for PDFs under `data/uploads/pdfs/`; reuse existing image/audio originals for reprocess.
- Compute `chunk_count` from Chroma by `file_id`; expose `transcription_language` if present.
- Soft delete via `is_soft_deleted` + chat retrieval filter keeps data but hides from UI/RAG.
- Multi-upload endpoint delegates to type-specific handlers for reuse and consistency.

**Challenges & Solutions**
- Updating vector metadata on reassign: delete+re-add with updated metadata and fresh embeddings.
- PDF reprocess without originals: solved by storing PDFs on upload and cleaning on hard delete.
- Ensuring prior tests unaffected: kept existing endpoints; added changes non-invasively; full suite passes.
- Existing local DBs without `is_soft_deleted`: added startup migration in `init_db()` to `ALTER TABLE` when needed.

**Notes for Future Tasks**
- Frontend: implement Files panel UI consuming these endpoints, including previews and download.
- Consider persisting `transcription_language` from ASR info explicitly in `AudioTranscriptionService`.
- Optional: add batch reprocessing and progress reporting for large queues.

**Manual E2E Verification (local)**
- Created session via `POST /api/sessions`.
- Generated and uploaded a demo PDF via `POST /api/files/upload` with `session_id`.
- Verified `GET /api/files?session_id=...&type=pdf` returns the file with a positive `chunk_count`.
- Confirmed chat SSE emits `: RAG_DEBUG { ... }` and token stream; soft-deleted files are excluded.

### TIP / Troubleshooting
- SQLite schema error (e.g., `table files has no column named is_soft_deleted`):
  - Option A: delete the dev DB `data/app.db` and restart the backend (DB will be recreated).
  - Option B: simply restart the backend; `init_db()` performs a lightweight migration (`ALTER TABLE`) to add missing columns.
- Heavy model download or CUDA errors during development:
  - Use a `.env` with:
    - `EMBEDDINGS_BACKEND=FAKE`
    - `EMBEDDINGS_DEVICE=cpu`  (required on this PC) [[memory:6252484]]
    - `RAG_DEBUG_MODE=true`
  - Restart the backend to pick up env changes.
- If `dev.ps1` windows close immediately on some shells:
  - Run generated scripts directly: `.dev-scripts/backend.dev.ps1` and `.dev-scripts/frontend.dev.ps1`, or start backend/frontend manually as documented in `README.md`.

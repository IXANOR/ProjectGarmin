# Task 014: AI Personality System

## Questions for Stakeholder/Owner (Decisions Taken)
- ✅ **Profiles**: List of predefined profiles (Formal, Friendly, Sarcastic, Jarvis-like, etc.) with ability for AI to adapt automatically to the user.
- ✅ **Adaptation**: Automatic adaptation to the user’s writing style and preferences, updated over time.
- ✅ **Parameters**:
  - Formality (formal / neutral / casual)
  - Humor level (none / moderate / frequent jokes)
  - Allow swearing (yes/no)
  - Response length (concise / normal / elaborate)
  - Answer detail level (low / medium / high)
  - Proactivity (whether AI suggests topics/tasks)
  - Communication style (technical / creative / mixed)
- ✅ **Profile storage**: Global profile stored and updated in DB.
- ✅ **Context integration**: Personality parameters injected into system prompt at start of session; middleware updates prompt dynamically as adaptation occurs.
- ✅ **UI**: Personality customization available to user, but main functionality is automatic AI adaptation.
- ✅ **TDD**: Tests for both manual settings and basic automatic adaptation (style detection).

## Overview
This task implements a dynamic AI personality system that adapts to the user’s communication style while also allowing manual customization.  
The personality influences tone, detail, humor, and other conversational traits to create a “Jarvis-like” assistant experience.

**Scope includes:**
- Backend logic for personality detection and adaptation.
- Database schema for storing and updating global personality profiles.
- UI for manual customization of personality settings.
- Integration of personality into AI system prompt.
- Middleware to adjust personality parameters during conversations.

**Scope excludes:**
- Multi-profile switching per session (future enhancement).
- Full advanced NLP-based psychological profiling (future research).

## Task Type
- [x] **Backend**
- [x] **Frontend**
- [x] **Integration**

## Acceptance Criteria
### Core Functionality
- [ ] Predefined personality profiles available in settings.
- [ ] Automatic adaptation of personality based on user’s chat history.
- [ ] Personality parameters affect AI tone, length, humor, and style.
- [ ] Profile stored globally in DB and updated as adaptation occurs.
- [ ] Middleware adjusts active prompt when personality changes.
- [ ] UI allows manual overrides for personality parameters.

### Integration & Quality
- [ ] TDD tests:
  - Manual personality changes persist and affect AI output.
  - Automatic adaptation detects style (formal vs. casual, humor presence, etc.).
  - Middleware updates prompt correctly without breaking context.
- [ ] Verify minimal performance impact from adaptation checks.

## Backend Requirements
- [ ] Create `services/personality_service.py` for detection and adaptation.
- [ ] DB table `personality_profile` with columns: `{formality, humor, swearing, length, detail, proactivity, style, last_updated}`.
- [ ] Middleware updates active session prompt with latest personality settings.
- [ ] API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/personality`
  - `POST /api/personality`
  - `PUT /api/personality`

## UI Requirements
- [ ] Personality settings panel with sliders/toggles for each parameter.
- [ ] Option to reset to predefined profiles.
- [ ] Display current detected personality parameters in real time.

## Expected Outcomes
- **For the user**: AI feels more personal, natural, and aligned with user’s communication style.
- **For the system**: Adaptive personality system without significant overhead.
- **For developers**: Framework for extending adaptation logic in future.
- **For QA**: Clear manual and automatic personality change verification paths.
